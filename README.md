# LinearProgramming
 Two problems from the "Operational Reasearch and Optimization" exam.
### Problem 1
Using either Python/Pulp or Julia/JuMP, submit a program that solves
the following problem:

A company plans its business in a three month period. It can produce
110 units at a cost of 600 each. The minimum amount it must produce
per month is 15 units if active (but of course, it can choose to be closed
during the month, and produce 0 units). Each month it can subcotract the
prodution of 60 units, at a cost of 660 each. Storing a unit for one month
costs 20$ per unit per month. The marketing department has forcasted
sales of 100, 130 and 150 units for the next three months, respectively.

The goal is to meet the demand each month while minimizing the total
cost.

You should send both a writeup (which explains how you model the problem and the result you got) and the source code of the program.

### Problem 2
Solve, perhaps using a program, the following problem: 

A consulting company estimates its business for the next five months, in hours, at
6000, 7000, 8000, 9500, 11000 hours, respectively. Currently the company employs 50 consultants, each at 160 hours/month, paid 2000 euros/month. To meet demand, company must recruit and retain new consultants. Training takes one month and 50 hours of supervision from an
existing consultant. Trainees are paid 1000 euros/month. After training,
5% of the trainees leave the firm.

Plan the activity to meet the demand and incur the minimum cost.

If you solve the problem using a computer program you should send both
a writeup (which explains how you model the problem and the result you
got) and the source code of the program.
